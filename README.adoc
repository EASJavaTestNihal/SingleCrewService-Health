[role='command']

Go to the http://HOST:PORT/openapi/ui/[^] URL to see the OpenAPI user interface (UI) that provides API documentation and a client to test the API endpoints that you create after you see a message similar to the following example:

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Wait until you see a message similar to the following example:
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Click the following button to see the OpenAPI user interface (UI) that provides API documentation and a client to test the API endpoints that you create:

::startApplication{port="9080" display="external" name="Visit OpenAPI UI" route="/openapi/ui"}
endif::[]

**Try the Create operation**

From the OpenAPI UI, test the create operation at the `POST /api/crew` endpoint by using the following code as the request body:

[role='command']
```
{
  "name": "Member1",
  "rank": "Officer",
  "crewID": "000001"
}
```

This request creates a new document in the `Crew` collection with a name of `Member1`, rank of `Officer`, and crew ID of `000001`.

You'll receive a response that contains the JSON object of the new crew member, as shown in the following example:
[role="no_copy"]
```
{
  "Name": "Member1",
  "Rank": "Officer",
  "CrewID": "000001",
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "<<ID>>"
  }
}
```


ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
The `\<<ID>>` that you receive is a unique identifier in the collection. Save this value for future commands.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
The ***\<\<ID\>\>*** that you receive is a unique identifier in the collection. Save this value for future commands.
endif::[]

**Try the Retrieve operation**

From the OpenAPI UI, test the read operation at the `GET /api/crew` endpoint. This request gets all crew member documents from the collection.

You'll receive a response that contains an array of all the members in your crew. The response might include crew members that were created in the **Try what youâ€™ll build** section of this guide:
[role="no_copy"]
```
[
  {
    "_id": {
      "$oid": "<<ID>>"
    },
    "Name": "Member1",
    "Rank": "Officer",
    "CrewID": "000001"
  }
]
```


**Try the Update operation**

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
From the OpenAPI UI, test the update operation at the `PUT /api/crew/{id}` endpoint, where the `{id}` parameter is the `\<<ID>>` that you saved from the create operation. Use the following code as the request body:
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
From the OpenAPI UI, test the update operation at the ***PUT /api/crew/{id}*** endpoint, where the ***{id}*** parameter is the ***\<\<ID\>\>*** that you saved from the create operation. Use the following code as the request body:
endif::[]

[role='command']
```
{
  "name": "Member1",
  "rank": "Captain",
  "crewID": "000001"
}
```

This request updates the rank of the crew member that you created from `Officer` to `Captain`.

You'll receive a response that contains the JSON object of the updated crew member, as shown in the following example:

[role="no_copy"]
```
{
  "Name": "Member1",
  "Rank": "Captain",
  "CrewID": "000001",
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "<<ID>>"
  }
}
```


**Try the Delete operation**

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
From the OpenAPI UI, test the delete operation at the `DELETE/api/crew/{id}` endpoint, where the `{id}` parameter is the `\<<ID>>` that you saved from the create operation. This request removes the document that contains the specified crew member object `id` from the collection.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
From the OpenAPI UI, test the delete operation at the ***DELETE/api/crew/{id}*** endpoint, where the ***{id}*** parameter is the ***\<\<ID\>\>*** that you saved from the create operation. This request removes the document that contains the specified crew member object ***id*** from the collection.
endif::[]

You'll receive a response that contains the object `id` of the deleted crew member, as shown in the following example:

[role="no_copy"]
```
{
  "_id": {
    "$oid": "<<ID>>"
  }
}
```

ifndef::cloud-hosted[]
Now, you can check out the microservice that you created by going to the http://HOST:PORT/CONTEXT_ROOT/[^] URL.
endif::[]

ifdef::cloud-hosted[]
Now, you can check out the microservice that you created by clicking the following button:

::startApplication{port="9080" display="external" name="Launch application" route="/mongo"}
endif::[]

Next, you'll create integration tests to ensure that the basic operations you implemented function correctly.

The test methods are annotated with the [hotspot=test1 hotspot=test2 hotspot=test3 hotspot=test4 file=0]`@Test` annotation.

The following test cases are included in this class:

* [hotspot=testAddCrewMember file=0]`testAddCrewMember()` verifies that new members are correctly added to the database.

* [hotspot=testUpdateCrewMember file=0]`testUpdateCrewMember()` verifies that a crew member's information is correctly updated.

* [hotspot=testGetCrewMembers file=0]`testGetCrewMembers()` verifies that a list of crew members is returned by the microservice API.

* [hotspot=testDeleteCrewMember file=0]`testDeleteCrewMember()` verifies that the crew members are correctly removed from the database.
